# Titanic_Project

On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic collided with an iceberg, sinking into one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone onboard, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers & crew. While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.

In this project, I used machine learning to create five base models, to predict whether a person on the Titanic was likely to survive or die. These models are:
1. Logistic Regression
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Multilayer Perceptron
4. Random Forest
5. Gradient Boosting

Following which, I created a stacked Ensemble Learning Model, making use of the predicted results of the five models above in an attempt to improve the overall performance. This model was created using XGBoost.

The dataset was retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/overview.
